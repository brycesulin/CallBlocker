For High-level requirements; I implemented everything except blocking calls in four different modes.
I have the radio buttons on the app, and everything else set up programmatically, but call blocking does not seem to be working even though the code looks correct.

For Functional requirements; I implemented everything that was asked for.

For Challenges; I implemented deleting numbers from the black list. The user has to long-click the number on the list and a Toast should
appear, asking if they want to do something to the number, and you select "delete". Also, I partially implemented editing numbers by long-clicking the number on the list,
and selecting the "edit" option. However, the number in the database is not changed when you try editing, even though it looks like it should be working based on the code.
